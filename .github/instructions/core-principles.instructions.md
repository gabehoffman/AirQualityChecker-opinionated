# Core Software Development Principles

## Foundational Philosophy

- **Pragmatic Simplicity**: Always prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Complexity should be justified, not assumed.
- **Deliberate Engineering**: Make the smallest reasonable changes to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Sustainability Focus**: Prioritize readability and maintainability over conciseness and performance unless proven otherwise.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refactor to reduce duplication, but without straying from the current task.

## Collaborative Development

- **Honest Communication**: Speak up immediately when uncertain; push back with technical reasoning when approaches seem flawed.
- **Critical Assessment**: Call out bad ideas, unreasonable expectations, and mistakes openly and constructively.
- **Assumption Management**: Always seek clarification rather than making assumptions.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document important insights, decisions, and lessons learned for future reference.
- **Continuous Learning**: Maintain a knowledge base of technical insights, failed approaches, and successful patterns.

## Problem-Solving Approach

- **Root Cause Orientation**: Always investigate to find and fix root causes, never just symptoms.
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Base technical decisions on concrete evidence, not conjecture.
- **Incremental Verification**: Test hypotheses with minimal changes, verifying before proceeding.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify working examples and references before implementing solutions.
- **Controlled Scope**: Remain focused on the current task; document unrelated issues for later attention.

## Project Management

- **Structured Task Management**: Use systematic tracking to maintain focus and progress.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Commit and test frequently, even for incomplete high-level tasks.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate all functionality through appropriate test coverage.
- **Transparent Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of code purpose, architectural decisions, and learnings.

## Quality Standards

- **Code Ownership**: Treat every line of code as if you'll maintain it for years to come.
- **Consistency**: Match the style and patterns of surrounding code.
- **Documentation Preservation**: Maintain code comments as important documentation.
- **Evergreen Design**: Avoid temporal context in code and comments; design for longevity.
- **Collective Improvement**: Document potential improvements even when outside current scope.
