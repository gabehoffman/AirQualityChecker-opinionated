# Engineering Guidance

- Use version control (Git) for all code and documentation.
- Write descriptive commit messages and use pull requests for all changes.
- Conduct code reviews for every pull request.
- Keep dependencies up to date and use dependency management tools.
- Automate testing and continuous integration (CI) where possible.
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all features and bug fixes.
- Monitor code quality with linters and static analysis tools.
- Document architecture, APIs, and important decisions.
- Use feature branches and follow a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
- Address technical debt regularly and prioritize refactoring when needed.
