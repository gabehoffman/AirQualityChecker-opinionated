# Copilot Instructions

These are general best practices and coding guidelines for this project. Copilot and agents should follow these instructions for all code generation and chat tasks in this workspace.

## General Coding Practices
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Prefer explicit over implicit code.
- Use meaningful variable, function, and class names.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
- Ensure code is secure and handles errors gracefully.

## Python and Django
- Use virtual environments for dependency management.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style.
- Organize Django apps logically and keep settings modular.
- Use Django's built-in features for security (e.g., CSRF protection, input validation).
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.

## Collaboration
- Write descriptive commit messages.
- Use pull requests for code review.
- Keep documentation up to date.

## Testing
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Use test coverage tools to ensure code quality.
- Fix failing tests before merging code.

## Additional Guidance
- Reference `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files for topic-specific guidance.
- Keep instructions and documentation organized and version controlled.
